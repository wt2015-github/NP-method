{"name":"NP-method","tagline":"A network propagation based method for inferring the perturbed microRNA regulatory networks from gene expression data","body":"R codes (Version 2013.12.13)\r\n\r\n[Homepage @ Github](http://wt2015-github.github.io/NP-method/) | [Homepage @ Jin Gu's Lab](http://bioinfo.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/member/jgu/np/) | [Source Code](https://github.com/wt2015-github/NP-method)\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\nThis network propagation based method (NP-method), takes advantage of the global network differential information, and carries out a integrated random walk plus forward searching algorithm to infer the perturbed miRNAs as well as their leading-edge target genes.\r\n\r\n## Details and Usage\r\n### R scripts (should be executed one bye one):\r\n1. **precalculate_M.R** to precalculate and prestore M matrix for NP-method, skip if using the default M matrix.\r\n2. **NP.fg.R** to get foreground NPES.\r\n3. **NP.bg.R** to get background NPES distributions using gene set permutation analysis, to save time users can execute parallelly, but please pay attention to the file directions.\r\n4. **NP.pvalue.R** to normalize NPES and get p-value using the outputs of NP.fg.R and NP.bg.R.\r\n\r\n### Input files:\r\n1. **A_adjmat_htri.Rdata**: A adjacent matrix for the HTRI network.\r\n2. **M_htri_rwr0.5.Rdata**: A N*N matrix, named p.single, which is precalculated as the M matrix of NP-method using precalculate.R (with parameters HTRI network and r=0.5).\r\n3. **TS6.2_hsa.miRFam.mat.txt**: A matrix representing the TargetScan v6.2 annotated conserved targets of miRNA families, each column is a geneset, 0/1 represents geneset containing the gene or not;\r\n4. **DE_test.GSE4107.txt**: A test gene differential expression file, 2 columns, first is gene name, second is score.\r\n\r\n### Output files:\r\n1 . Output of **precalculate_M.R**\r\n\r\n* **M matrix file**: containing a matrix variable named p.single.\r\n\r\n2 . Outputs of **NP.fg.R**\r\n\r\n* **NPES.txt**: foreground NPES and size information\r\n\r\n* **LE.txt**: leading-edge (LE) targets\r\n\r\n* **genelist.net.txt**: intermediate file, expressions of genes in networks\r\n\r\n* **geneset.net.txt**: intermediate file, genesets containing the genes in networks\r\n\r\n* **gene_p.single.txt**: intermediate file, sorted network genes according to single seed based RWR in the farward searching procedure\r\n\r\n* **score_rank.txt**: intermediate file, sorted targets, fold change and NPES scores of each miRNA target set, every 3 lines are these information of one miRNA target set\r\n\r\n3 . Outputs of **NP.bg.R**\r\n\r\n* **NPES.bg.txt**: background NPES\r\n\r\n4 . Output of **NP.pvalue.R**\r\n\r\n* **NPES_result.txt**: results of the NPES score, normalized score, p-value and FDR for each miRNA\r\n\r\n**Note**: some NA values in some outputs are reasonable (including the warnings during runing R), because not all genes in network have expression measurements.\r\n\r\n## Publication\r\nTing Wang, Jin Gu, Yanda Li. \"Inferring the perturbed microRNA regulatory networks from gene expression data using a network propagation based method.\" *BMC bioinformatics* 15.1 (2014): 255.
